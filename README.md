                                Problem Statement 
Mental health issues have become a major concern in the growing corporate world. Due to the 
competitive nature in the workplace, employees face high levels of anxiety, stress, and 
depression. This not only affects the well-being of the employee, but also has an impact on the 
overall growth and productivity of the organization. To address this problem, we use data 
intensive computing techniques to analyze a dataset consisting of the employee data and gain 
insights about the mental health in the corporate world. 


                                Questions to Answer 
How important is mental health in the corporate world? 
How well are they offering the resources for mental health-related issues? 
Based on how the company prioritizes mental health and benefits a person, is that person going 
to take treatment or not? 


                                  Background 
The mental health problem in the corporate world has been increasing steadily from the past 
few years. Due to the rapid evolution and growth of the corporate world by new technologies, 
there are many factors that affect the mental health of the employees. Factors like higher 
workload, working for long hours, job insecurity, not able to maintain healthy work-life balance 
cause mental health problem in employees which lead to stress, anxiety and depression. These 
factors affect employee’s quality and well-being of life and results in lower productivity of the 
entire organization. With all these factors considered, mental health in the corporate world has 
become a significant problem and this problem needs to be addressed. 


                        Project’s potential contribution 
This project has the potential to significantly contribute to the problem of mental health in 
corporate world, and its contribution is critical in many ways: 
1. By using the data intensive computing approach, our project can identify the causes for 
mental health issues in employees. We can also find patterns using the data which 
cannot be found using other conventional traditional methods. 
2. We can also build predictive models which identify the mental health risk of employees. 
By this we can take suitable actions beforehand and prevent further mental health 
crises. 
3. By implementing this project, we can identify the strategies that can be used by the 
organizations for better well-being of the employees. 
4. This project can also contribute to the research on mental health challenges in the 
corporate world and results can be used for further studies.
